2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks bftClk and wbClk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks bftClk] -to [get_clocks wbClk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks wbClk and bftClk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks wbClk] -to [get_clocks bftClk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks bftClk and wbClk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks bftClk] -to [get_clocks wbClk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks
